## What is good code?

- Readable
- Scalable (Big O)
** How long an algorithm takes to run. When the input grows, how much does the algorithm slow down.
** How much memory a computer has

## The Runtime

- How long it takes to run a certain problem through a function or a task

## 3 Pillars of code 

- Write readable, clean code that is maintainable 
- Has a good time complexity (speed) 
- What's the space complexity (memory) usage of code
