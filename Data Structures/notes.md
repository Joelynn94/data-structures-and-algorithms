## What is a data structure?

- A way for us to organize data.

- A data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data

### 2 parts to understanding data structures

- How to build a data structure (with code)
- How to use a data structure (when to use one over another)

## Operations on data structures

- Access (how to access data)
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Traversal (access each data item once, so it can be processed)
- Searching (location of a data item in a collection)
- Sorting

## What a computer needs to run code

CPU, RAM, Storage (permanant)

- (CPU) When a variable is declared in a script, it's going to get held in (RAM)
- (Storage) persistant storage

- RAM have "shelves" that have an address. Each shelf has 1 byte of information. Each address has 8 bits (a 1 or 0). 8 bits are equal to 1 byte.
- The CPU has access to all of these addresses (connections)
- The CPU has a tiny bit of storage (cache)
